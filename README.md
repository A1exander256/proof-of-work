## Comment
This project uses a simplified `Proof-of-Work (POW)` algorithm inspired by [Hashcash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash). 
The server issues a challenge containing a random seed and a difficulty level. 
The client must find a nonce such that the `SHA-256 hash` of `seed + nonce` has a given number of leading
zero bits.

This approach helps mitigate denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks by forcing clients to spend computational effort 
before the server responds. 
Itâ€™s lightweight, easy to implement, and does not rely on external state or synchronization, 
making it suitable for TCP-based challenge-response systems.

### First run
```
1. cp .env.dist .env

# docker-compose up
make up

# docker-compose down
make down
```
